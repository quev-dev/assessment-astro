# Astro Assessment

## Introduction

A static web app developed within 10 days; it mimics the common features of a blog using Astro.js, Tailwind CSS and Markdown. It was developed & deployed as an assessment.

> The live version of the site can be found [here](https://quevdev-astro-assessment.netlify.app).

You can learn more about this small project's features below.

## Features

### Homepage

The homepage displays a grid of images which fetch images of dogs from [this api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) with error handling.

There is also an embedded YouTube video accompanying the homepage post, featuring the rescue of a dog. The featured channel can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@HowlOfADog).

### Posts

The posts page mimics the posts you'd find on a blog site - each post is created and formatted with Markdown. Each post has a unique ID, allowing you to click and open each post to view them in great detail (like you would with posts on social media sites).

- Each post has made-up comments, displayed at the bottom of the blog post.
