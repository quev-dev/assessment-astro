# Astro Assessment

## Introduction

This static web app built with Astro.js mimics the common features of a blog. It was developed & deployed within 10 days as an assessment.

> The live version of the site can be found [here](https://quevdev-astro-assessment.netlify.app).

You can learn more about this short project's features below.

## Features

### Homepage

The homepage displays a grid of images which fetch images of dogs from this [dog image api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) with error handling.

There is also an embedded YouTube video below the image grid, featuring the rescue of a dog.

### Posts

The posts page mimics the posts you'd find on a blog site - each post is created and formatted with Markdown. Each post has a unique ID, allowing you to click and open each post to view them in great detail (like you would with posts on social media sites).

### About
